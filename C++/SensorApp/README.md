# Sensor Data Simulation

This C++ program simulates the reading of sensor data for temperature, humidity, and pressure. It generates a specified number of sensor readings at regular intervals and calculates the average values for each parameter.

## Features

- Simulates sensor data readings for temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- Generates random readings within specified ranges:
  - Temperature: 20.0°C to 30.0°C
  - Humidity: 30.0% to 60.0%
  - Pressure: 980.0 hPa to 1020.0 hPa
- Calculates and displays the average values for each sensor reading over the course of the simulation.


### Compile:
g++ main.cpp -o main

### Run:
.\main
