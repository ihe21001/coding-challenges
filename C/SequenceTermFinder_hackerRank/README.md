# Sequence Term Finder

## Overview
This C program calculates the nth term of a sequence where each term (from the 4th term onwards) is the sum of the preceding three terms. It's a simple implementation of a recursive function in C.

## Example
Input: `10 5 6 7`

The program will then calculate the 10th term of the sequence. In this sequence:
- The 4th term is 18 (5 + 6 + 7),
- The 5th term is 31 (6 + 7 + 18),
- And so on, until the 10th term is calculated.

Output: `The 10th term in the sequence is: [calculated value]`
